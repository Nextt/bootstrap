  "Simple, flexible markup": "TODO",

  "Lastly, the thumbnails component uses existing grid system classes&mdash;like <code>.span2</code> or <code>.span3</code>&mdash;for control of thumbnail dimensions.": "TODO",
  "The markup": "TODO",
  "As mentioned previously, the required markup for thumbnails is light and straightforward. Here's a look at the default setup <strong>for linked images</strong>:": "TODO",
